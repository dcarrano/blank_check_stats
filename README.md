# Real Nerdy Stats

This Python project uses the [Rotten Tomatoes Scraper](https://github.com/pdrm83/rotten_tomatoes_scraper) package to compile information about movies discussed by the podcast [Blank Check with Griffin and David](https://audioboom.com/channel/Blank-Check).

Running the **blank_check.ipynb** Python notebook will create a file called **blank_check.csv** with the compiled stats. (I've also uploaded these contents to [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10tcmKe5NDox3cyafL8EGctQ5L4p7ANUljjqVX1BW_TQ/edit?usp=sharing).)

To run the notebook, you'll need the Rotten Tomatoes Scraper package, and all the packages upon which it in turn is dependent. You'll also need the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) package.

Enjoy!
