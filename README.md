# Real Nerdy Stats

This Python project uses the [Rotten Tomatoes Scraper](https://github.com/pdrm83/rotten_tomatoes_scraper) package to compile information about movies discussed by the podcast [Blank Check with Griffin and David](https://audioboom.com/channel/Blank-Check).

Running the **blank_check.ipynb** Python notebook will create a file called **blank_check.csv** with the compiled stats. (I've also uploaded these contents to Google Sheets.)

To run the notebook, you'll need the Rotten Tomatoes Scraper package, and all the packages upon which it in turn is dependent. You'll also need the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) package.

Enjoy!
